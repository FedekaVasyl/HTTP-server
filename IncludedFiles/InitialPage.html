                   The server is written using sockets technology. The server returns the
				   requested page, responds to the mistakes from both the user and the server sides.
				   The server keeps a log of events, because every event that happens on the server 
				   is written in a separate file (log.txt), which recorded the event status, time and
				   date of occurrence and description of the event. Developed console menu for the
				   service, which allows you to start and stop the server, enable and disable logging,
				   change the path to the log-file, and also the correct exit from the program.
